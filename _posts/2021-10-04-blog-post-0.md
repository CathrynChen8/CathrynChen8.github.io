## Graph on Penguin Data: "I want to know more about Penguins"


This is a quick introduction about how to draw a simple graph on data in python.

### Preparation
 Reading the data

Let's start by reading the data into our python!
(Here is the code provided)

Firstly, we import the pandas library, and
```python
import pandas as pd
```

Then we get the url to approach the data, and read it into python as Penguins:
```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Let's get an easy Graph

Start with import library again, while this time we need the matplotlib library.
To make it easier to be used, we name the pyplot as plt.


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

We then look at the data we have, and see which variable we want to investigate about.

```python
penguins.head()
```

From the penguins, we can get many information, including species, region, island, date egg, Culmen length, etc.

We then can simply pick two variables that we are interested in, for example, species and Culmen Length.

What is Culmen length then:

("https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1270046411002753025", picture from twitter)

The Culmen length is simply like the length of the bird's bill.

Then, regarding the relationship we want to investigate, by general biological knowledge, it seems like different species of penguins have different appearance, and thus different Culmen length.

We can first utilize the plot function in matplotlib to draw the relationship diagram.

Here, the x variable is the species, and the y variable is Culmen length.

```python
plt.plot(penguins["Species"], penguins["Culmen Length (mm)"])
plt.show()
```

We can add some more information on it.
We add the following information to the graph:
1. x-axis name: Species
2. y-axis name: Culmen Length(mm)
3. Title name : Culmen length(mm) for different Species of Penguins

```python
plt.xlabel('Species') #x-label name
plt.ylabel('Culmen Length(mm)') #y-label name
plt.title('Culmen length(mm) for different Species of Penguins') #title name
plt.show()
```

It looks ok now! The only question is that the x-axis is overlapping. We will rotate it to make it clearer to read.

```python
plt.xticks(rotation=5) #rotate the x-axis ticks
plt.show()
```

What we have in the graph is three vertical lines for three penguins type (Adelie penguin, Chinstrap penguin, and Gentoo penguin), the vertical lines indicate numerical interval for penguin culmen length based on the given data for each species of penguin seperately.

As noted from the graph, it also has horizontal lines connected between each vertical line of different types of penguins. The lines connect the mean of culmen length for different kinds of penguin. Adelie penguins have mean of culmen length for about 42, while Chinstrap penguins have mean at about 48, Gentoo penguins have mean for about 45. It seems that Chinstrap penguins have highest Culmen length, and Adelie penguins have shortest one. 


Through easy plt.plot function in python, we can get the graph about culmen length difference with respect to the specied of penguins, and futher compare the culmen length.

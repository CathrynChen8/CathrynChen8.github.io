## Scraping your favorite movie

### Where is the IMDB page for my movie (my scraping journey)

One of my favorite movies that I picked here is **The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring**. The IMDB page of this movie is https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/.

As pointed out by the blog post, I should further access the *Cast&Crew*, and go to the page https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/fullcredits.

Finally, from the *Cast&Crew*, we can access the pages of each actors and get all the movies of that actor.

### My useful scraper

Here's a link to my project repository: https://github.com/CathrynChen8/scraper-bp3

Initialize the repository after create it in Github Desktop

```python
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```

#### How we set up the scraper

We first initialize the class of the scraper with name imdb_spider and start url of our movie:

```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/']

```

#### Parse Method

The first method we want to implement is the parse method, that allows us to start from one movie page and then navigate to the *Cast&Crew* page of the movie page:

```python
def parse(self, response):
        cast_page = response.urljoin("fullcredits") #we join the suffix of the Cast&Crew page to the original page
        
        yield scrapy.Request(cast_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits) #access the parse_full_credits method with the castpage we get
```

We get navigate to page of cast.

#### Parse_full_credits Method

The second method we implemented is he parse_full_credit method, which allows us to use the cast page and get all the prefix of the actor page. Then, using the actor page conbined, we call the parse_actor_page with actor page and further move on.

```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        actors = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")] #get access to the 

        for actor in actors:
    
            actor_urls = response.urljoin(actor)
            yield scrapy.Request(actor_urls, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

Now, we access the actor page for every actors in the *Cast&Crew* page and use the parse_actor_page.

#### Parse_actor_page Method

The last method, where we retrieve the final name and movie, is the parse_actor_page. We get the movies and the name of the actor and the movie of the actor from the actor page, get the dictonary from that and final return the output.

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        movies = response.css("b a::text").getall() #get every movies name of the actor in the actor_page
        name = response.css("div span.itemprop::text").get() #get the name of the actor
        
        for movie in movies: #since we want to pair the movie with the actor, for every movie we pair with the actor name
            yield {
                "name" : name,
                "movie": movie }
```

#### Save the result

Use this command to run the spider and save the csv file as results.csv:

```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

### Recommendation based on actor

From the data gained from the scraper, we can create list with top movies and TV shows that share actors with your favorite movie or TV show. We can utilize value_counts() to get the frequency list.

```python
import pandas as pd #import the panda library needed
data = pd.read_csv("results.csv") #read the csv as data
df = data["movie"].value_counts().rename_axis('movie').reset_index(name= 'number of shared actors') #use the value_counts() function to help gain the frenquency list of movie column of the data
df.head(10) #get the first ten movies
```

      <td>Weta Workshop</td>
      <td>29</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Mortal Engines</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>


We get the table of the movies that have most actors of this movie in. It makes sense that the series of The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbits "shares" the most actors since they are the same series as **The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring**.

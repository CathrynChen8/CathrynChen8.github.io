## Interesting Figures

### Create a Database


Firstly, we import the sqlite3 module and other module we need, and using it to connect to a database called temps.db. If it does not exist, then it will create one.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.io import write_html
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #connect to a database
```

Then we will try to add data to the database byusing pd.read_cse() function with value chunksize that makes read_csv() return iterator. We will then use the iterator to access the piece of data with number of rows equal to chunksize.


```python
df_iter  = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000) #read the csv
df = df_iter.__next__()

```

We then will prepare the df and change the variable to the form we needed:

```python
def prepare_df(df): #prepare the data_frame for later use
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])  #set the index of the df as ID and Year
    df = df.stack() #return the reshaped DataFrame based on index 
    df = df.reset_index()  #reset the index
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"}) #change the name fo the column to Month and Temp
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int) #get the month variable
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100 #change the unit of the temperature
    return(df)


df= prepare_df(df)
df.head()

```



<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Temp</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>1961</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-0.89</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>1961</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2.36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>1961</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4.72</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>1961</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>7.73</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>1961</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>11.28</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>





Then we are ready to populate a table to our database!

We use the df.sql() methods to write the table to our database, and we use if_exists to append factor to the table instead of overwrite it.

```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000) #read the csv with chunk size
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False) #write the datafram to the database
```

We use similar method for stations and countries. However, since they are small data set, we do not need to worry about chunks.

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url) #read data from the url
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)  #read it to database

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(url)

countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False) 

```

We check the database's table inside the database.

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'") #select all table kind variable from out database #get names for the table in the database
print(cursor.fetchall()) #print all results we get
```

```
[('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]
```


We can see that we have three tables, naming temperatures, stations, and countries.

### Query function

We define the functtion with the parameter we want to input into it. We use the cmd to write our selection and filter parameter

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.Name, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp #variable we want to see in the final table #variable we want
    FROM temperatures T #table to select from
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id #join the station to temperature table by matching id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 1,2) = C."FIPS 10-4" #join the country table to temperature table by matching the FIPS with the first two letter of temp.id
    WHERE C.Name == ? AND T.Year >= ? AND T.Year <= ? AND T.Month == ? #filter condition for our cases
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = [country, year_begin, year_end, month])
    return df
```

We then use the test case to see what we can get:

```python
df = query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
df.head()
```

### Geographic Scatter Function

We want to draw a scatter function for yearly temperature increase here. We can actually get the dataframe with desired information from the function above. Then we will employ it and further develop the graph.

Since we want yearly temperture increase, we need first employ the coefs function to get the desired first coefficient. (I got them from the lecture note)

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

Then, after introduce the coef function, we can do develop the graphing function we want.

```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    df["len"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len) #get the length
    new_df = df[df["len"]>min_obs] #filter the minimum require number of year
    coefs = new_df.groupby(["NAME", "Month", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef) #apply the coef function
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.round(decimals=4) #set the decimal to 4 to make it clear to read
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns={0: 'Estimated Yearly Increase(°C)'}) #change the column name
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        color = "Estimated Yearly Increase(°C)", 
                        color_continuous_midpoint = 0, #here we try to set the color bar centered at 0
                        title="Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in " + calendar.month_name[int(month)] + "for stations in " + country + ", years " + str(year_begin) + " - " + str(year_end), 
                        **kwargs)
    return fig
```


We will use the test case to test the result we get.

```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
fig.show()
```

Looks nice!

### Two More Interesting Figures

#### First Question: How does the temperature changes for a given country with in a year with respect to months?

What we try to understand is the trend of temperature of our interested country within one specific year. We will use stations as variable to see how it different for different stations.

We will use the same method, begin from doing data manipulation and get the variable we want to get. We input the year and the country we are interested in.

```python
def country_weather_development(year, country):
    
    
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name,  C.Name, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id #join the table based on T.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 1,2) = C."FIPS 10-4" #join table based on first two letter of T.id and FIPS 10-4 in country table
    WHERE T.Year == ? AND C.Name == ? #filter with this condition
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = [year, country])
    return df
```

We match the year and name to want we want to know, and then we can begin to graph what we want. For the graph, I use the px.line() function to create interactive line graph.

```python
def graph_weather_development(year, country):
    df = country_weather_development(year, country) #use the function above to get the data wanted
    fig = px.line(df, x='Month', y="Temp", color = "NAME") #draw the line fraph for the data
    return fig
```

Let's try it!

```python
graph_weather_development(2010, "India")
```
{% include fig4.html %}




What we get is a line interactive graph with trend over specific year in line format. We can interact with it by clicking on the station we want to understand about. SRINGAR has the lowest temperature, we can see from the graph, and the general trend is that it is higher in summer and lower in January and December.


#### Second Question: How does the temperature varies for a given station for two specific years?

We want to compare the temperature between two year in each month within the station we curious about. 

Begin from data manipulation again, we can get a datafram with variables needed. We input two years we want to compare, and the name of the station.

```python
def station_weather_development(year_1, year_2, station):
    
    
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp 
    FROM temperatures T #"base" table
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id #join the table based on id
    WHERE T.Year == ? AND S.NAME = ? OR T.Year == ? AND S.NAME == ?  #filter the condition
    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = [year_1, station, year_2, station]) #do the query for data needed
    return df

```

Then we are going to use this function to draw the graph.

```python
def graph_station_weather_development(year_1, year_2, station):
    df = station_weather_development(year_1, year_2, station) #get the dataframe
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Histogram(histfunc="avg", y=df[df["Year"] == year_1]["Temp"], x=df[df["Year"] == year_1]["Month"], name= year_1)) #first histogram calculating average
    fig.add_trace(go.Histogram(histfunc="avg", y=df[df["Year"] == year_2]["Temp"], x=df[df["Year"] == year_2]["Month"], name= year_2)) #second histogram calculating average
    fig.update_layout(
        title_text='Mean temperature for every month in station ' + station, 
        xaxis_title_text='Month', 
        yaxis_title_text='Temperature', 
        bargap=0.2, 
        bargroupgap=0.1 
    )
    return fig

```

We will test it with one case.

```python
graph_station_weather_development(2007, 2014, "SAVE")
```
